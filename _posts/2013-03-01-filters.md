Now we can simply enable clients to communicate each other without the server's interaction. But what if we need to monitor and alter the content, which clients are communicating.

**Filters** are the solution for that. With filters, you can monitor and alter arguments passed to events. See following diagram for the place where filters exists.

![How Meteor Streams Works](http://i.imgur.com/MX0yZVG.png)

Here's how you can create a filter

    var stream = new Meteor.Stream('hello');

    stream.addFilter(function(eventName, args) {
      var userId = this.userId; //you can get the userId if user is logged in
      //alter and modify args array

      return args;
    });

Concept of the filters is very simple. You'll get the argument list as the `args` array. Then you can alter it. After that return the altered args array or a new one. Receivers will get this altered args array instead of the original.

You can add multiple filters if you want. If added they act like a chain; return value of a filter will be the input arguments for the next filter.
